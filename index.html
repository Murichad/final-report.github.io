					<h3>Goal 1: Provide information about benefits of IT development in your country. </h3>
					<p>IT is permeating every aspect of life, providing people with new, better and faster ways to interact, communicate, seek help, access information and learn. In addition to its ubiquitous presence, ITs have enormous economic significance. According to research from consulting firm IDC, the global information technology industry exceeded $5 trillion in 2020.
						The ICT sector influences economic growth and incomes of the population through several channels: influence on the education system, including through the introduction of online lessons and courses, growth in the activities of financial organizations, reduction in unemployment due to new professions and jobs, including in online space.
						The Institute for Forecasting and Macroeconomic Research (IFMR) assessed the contribution from the development of information and communication infrastructure to the real income of the population in Uzbekistan. Based on the analysis, the following results were obtained:
						An increase in the length of fiber-optic communication lines by 100 km contributes to the growth of real incomes of the population by 1.43%
						Increase in Internet users by 1 p.p. will lead to an increase in real incomes of the population by 0.9%.
						
						So, for 2019–2021. The transmission speed of wired Internet almost doubled (up to 40 Mbit/s), the number of Internet users exceeded 70% of the population.
						To analyze the impact of IT on the growth of real incomes of the population in Uzbekistan, IFMR experts used econometric models based on statistical data from the Stat6e Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Uzbekistan by region (12 regions, the Republic of Karakalpakstan and the city of Tashkent) for the period from 2015 to 2020 (84 observations )</p>

					<h3>Goal 2: Provide information about specific problems caused by IT development in your country. </h3>
					<p>Electronic waste (e-waste) is the fastest growing solid waste stream in the world, increasing 3 times faster than the world’s population. Less than a quarter of e-waste produced globally in 2019 was known to be formally recycled; however, e-waste streams contain valuable and finite resources that can be reused if they are recycled appropriately. E-waste has therefore become an important income stream for individuals and even communities. Despite international regulations targeting the control of the transport of e-waste from one country to another, the transboundary movement of e-waste to LMICs continues, frequently illegally. E-waste is considered hazardous waste as it contains toxic materials or can produce toxic chemicals when treated inappropriately. Many of these toxic materials are known or suspected to cause harm to human health, and several  are included in the 10 chemicals of public health concern, including dioxins, lead and mercury. Inferior recycling of e-waste is a threat to public health and safety.</p>

					<h3>Goal 3: Propose possible solutions for the environmental problems caused by IT development. </h3>
					<p>National and international actions are essential to protect communities from dangerous e-waste recycling activities. Actions that can be taken include: 
						 Adopting and enforcing high-level international agreements; 
						 Monitoring e-waste sites and surrounding communities. 
						 Build e-waste recycling plants. 
						 Implement e-waste management legislation that protects public health 
						 Create new jobs for finding and eliminating electronic waste 
						 Developing and implementing national e-waste management legislation that protects public health;
						 Incorporating health protection measures into national legislation; 
						 Monitoring e-waste sites and surrounding communities; 
						 Implementing and monitoring interventions that improve informal e-waste recycling activities, protect public health and ensure vital sources of community revenue;
						 Educating health workers across all levels on e-waste-related child health issues;</p>
